Call for papers
=============== 

Universal Dependencies (UD) is a framework for cross-linguistically
consistent treebank annotation that has so far been applied to over 100
languages
([https://universaldependencies.org](https://universaldependencies.org/)).
The framework is aiming to capture similarities as well as
idiosyncrasies among typologically different languages (e.g.,
morphologically rich languages, pro-drop languages, and languages
featuring clitic doubling). The goal in developing UD was not only to
support comparative evaluation and cross-lingual learning but also to
facilitate multilingual natural language processing and enable
comparative linguistic studies.

The Universal Dependencies workshop series was started to create a forum
for discussion of the theory and practice of UD, its use in research and
development, and its future goals and challenges. The five workshops so
far were held at NoDaLiDa in Gothenburg (2017), at EMNLP in Brussels
(2018), at SyntaxFest in Paris and Online (2019 and 2021) and at COLING
online (2020). The sixth workshop on Universal Dependencies will take
place during the week of March 9th-12th, 2023 in Washington D.C. on the
campus of Georgetown University as part of GURT 2023. We invite papers
on all topics relevant to UD, including but not limited to:

- Theoretical foundations and universal guidelines
- Linguistic analysis of specific languages and/or constructions
- Language typology and linguistic universals
- Treebank annotation, conversion and validation
- Word segmentation, morphological tagging and syntactic parsing
- Downstream applications in natural language processing
- Linguistic studies based on the UD data

Priority will be given to papers that adopt a cross-lingual perspective.

## Submission informations

We invite paper submissions in two distinct tracks:

- Regular papers on substantial, original, and unpublished research, including empirical evaluation
    results, where appropriate
- Short papers on smaller, focused contributions, work in progress, negative results, surveys, or
    opinion pieces.

All papers accepted for presentation at the workshop will be included in the UDW 2023 proceedings
volume, which will be part of the ACL Anthology.

Long papers may consist of up to 8 pages of content (excluding references and appendices). Short
papers may consist of up to 4 pages of content (excluding references and appendices). Accepted
papers will be given an additional page to address reviewer comments. All submissions should follow
the two-column format and the ACL style guidelines. We strongly recommend the use of the LaTeX style
files, OpenDocument, or Microsoft Word templates created for ACL:
<https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files>

All papers must be anonymous, i.e., not reveal author(s) on the title page or through
self-references. So, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith,
2020) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith (2020) previously showed ...".
Papers must be submitted digitally, in PDF, and uploaded through the on-line conference system (link
forthcoming).

Double submission policy: We will accept submissions that have been or will be submitted elsewhere,
but require that the authors notify us, including information on where else they are submitting. We
also require that authors withdraw work that will be published elsewhere (no double publication).

Submissions that violate these requirements will be rejected without review.

Papers should describe original work; they should emphasise completed work rather than intended
work, and should indicate clearly the state of completion of the reported results. Submissions will
be judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, significance and relevance to the
conference, and interest to the attendees.

All papers will be refereed through a double-blind peer review process with final acceptance
decisions made by the workshop organisers. Submissions may be selected for publication in a GURT
venue other than UDW at the discretion of the organisers.

## Venue

The Georgetown University Round Table on Linguistics (GURT) is a
peer-reviewed annual linguistics conference held continuously since 1949
at Georgetown University in Washington DC, with topics and co-located
events varying from year to year. Under an overarching theme of
'Computational and Corpus Linguistics', GURT 2023 will feature four
workshops focused on computational and corpus approaches to syntax: UDW,
Depling, TLT, and CxGs+NLP. Talks will take place in plenary sessions to
promote cross-fertilization of ideas across subcommunities. Proceedings
will be published in the ACL Anthology.

In order to support rich discussions and networking with minimal
overhead and cost, GURT will be primarily an in-person event; we will,
however, accommodate a limited number of live/synchronous remote
presentations, prioritizing those with circumstances that prevent
travel. University policies regarding COVID safety will be in force
during the event.L

Georgetown University is located in a historic neighbourhood in the heart
of the nation's capital. The city is a premier tourist destination,
accessible by train via the Washington Union station, and the region is
served by the Reagan National (DCA), Dulles (IAD), and
Baltimore-Washington (BWI) airports.
